          Start your journey by heading west on Lighthouse Road, keeping the
          scenic coastline to your left. Continue for about 2 miles until you

          Boulevard. You’ll pass by several charming seaside cafes and art
          galleries. Continue straight for 3 miles until you see signs for Port
          Harbor. Take a Right onto Harbor Drive As you approach the bustling
          Port Harbor, take a right onto Harbor Drive. You’ll notice the smell
          of fresh sea air and the sound of seagulls as you drive past the
          marina. Continue along Harbor Drive for 1 mile. Turn Left onto Seawind
          Lane After passing the historic Shipwright’s Inn on your right, take a

          mile. Arrive at Captain’s Cove Sailboats & Supplies Look for a large
          wooden sign with a carved sailboat logo on your right. The shop has a
          bright blue facade with nautical flags hanging out front. There’s
          plenty of parking available in the lot beside the shop.
