            <h3>Laser Sailboats</h3>
            <img src="./images/laser.jpg" alt="laser sailboat" />
            <p>
              Laser sailboats, often simply called "Lasers," are a popular class
              of small, single-handed sailing dinghies known for their
              simplicity, performance, and widespread appeal. Designed in 1969
              by Bruce Kirby, the Laser is characterized by its lightweight
              design, easy-to-rig sail, and a strict one-design principle that
              ensures all boats are virtually identical. This allows sailors to
              compete on skill alone, making it a favorite in competitive
              sailing, including the Olympics. Despite its small size, the Laser
              is highly responsive and capable of exhilarating speeds, offering
              both beginners and seasoned sailors a challenging and rewarding
              experience on the water.

            <p>
              Wayfarer sailboats are versatile, durable dinghies renowned for
              their stability, spacious design, and suitability for both
              cruising and racing. Designed in 1957 by Ian Proctor, the Wayfarer
              is a 16-foot boat that comfortably accommodates up to six people,
              making it ideal for family outings or group sailing adventures.
              Its robust construction and seaworthiness allow it to handle
              various conditions, from calm inland waters to more challenging
              coastal environments. The Wayfarerâ€™s adaptability has made it a
              favorite for training, cruising, and competitive sailing, offering
              a perfect balance between ease of use and performance.

              A 30-foot yacht is a versatile and accessible choice for sailors
              seeking a balance between size, comfort, and ease of handling.
              These yachts are compact enough to be easily managed by a small
              crew or even single-handed, yet spacious enough to offer
              comfortable accommodations for weekend cruising or short coastal
              trips. Typically featuring a small cabin with sleeping berths, a
              galley, and a bathroom, a 30-foot yacht provides the essentials
              for enjoying life on the water. Ideal for both novice sailors and
              those looking for a manageable vessel, these yachts offer a blend

              A 40-foot sailboat represents a perfect balance between size,
              comfort, and performance, making it a popular choice for both
              serious cruisers and liveaboard sailors. These mid-sized yachts
